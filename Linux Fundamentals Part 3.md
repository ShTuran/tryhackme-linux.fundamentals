# Ensure you are connected to the deployed instance 

- To connect the server use `ssh`

`ssh tryhackme@machine_ip_address` 

#  Now, use Python 3's "HTTPServer" module to start a web server in the home directory of the "tryhackme" user on the deployed instance.

`python -m http.server`

# Download the file http://machine_ip_address:8000/.flag.txt onto the TryHackMe AttackBox. Remember, you will need to do this in a new terminal. What are the contents?

- Note that above IP address is only specific to the user, you need to change it.

# Create and download files to further apply your learning -- see how you can read the documentation on Python3's "HTTPServer" module.  Use Ctrl + C to stop the Python3 HTTPServer module once you are finished.

#  If we were to launch a process where the previous ID was "300", what would the ID of this new process be?

- '301', processes increase one-by-one.

#  If we wanted to cleanly kill a process, what signal would we send it?

- 'SIGTERM' , this will cleanup tasks beforehand

#  Locate the process that is running on the deployed instance (10.10.202.248). What flag is given?

# What command would we use to stop the service "myservice"?

- We need to follow this syntax -> systemctl [option] service

-  `systemctl stop myservice`
 
# What command would we use to start the same service on the boot-up of the system?

Again the same syntax, but it says 'boot-up' you have to use enable/disable command, since wanted to start on boot up:

- `systemctl enable myservice`

# What command would we use to bring a previously backgrounded process back to the foreground?

- `fg` will bring back the backgrounded command.


# Ensure you are connected to the deployed instance and look at the running crontabs.

`crontab -l` will list current user cronjobs.
