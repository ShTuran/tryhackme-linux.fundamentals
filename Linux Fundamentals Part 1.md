I used single, double quotes and without them :)


# What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine?

- To display current username use `whoami` command

`whoami` -> will output 'tryhackme'

# Which directory contains a file? 

`cd` command will change directory, to enter the directory use `cd 'filenmae'`. If you navigate to folder4 and list its content (`ls`) you will see that there is file there.

# What is the contents of this file?

- To see content of any file `cat` is most used one. In our case,

`cat 'note.txt'`  -> "Hello World!"

# Use the cd command to navigate to this file and find out the new current working directory. What is the path?

- After navigating to file location (use above knowledge),
- To learn your absolute directory type `pwd` -> print working directory -> will output this: '/home/tryhackme/folder4'

# Use grep on "access.log" to find the flag that has a prefix of "THM". What is the flag?

- 'grep' command will search any text pattern provided by the user.

  `grep "THM" access.log` will reveal the flag. -> THM{******}

# If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use? 

`&`  will make process to run in the background, usually using this sign when assuming that command result relatively will be late.


# If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be?

`echo password123 > passwords`

 `>` will overwrite it!

# Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be

`echo tryhackme >> passwords`

`>>` append it!
